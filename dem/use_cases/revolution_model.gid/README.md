# Revolution test

**Author:** Salva Latorre

## Case Specification

This case simulates the rotation of a drum containing a fair amount of granular material. The main results of interest in this problem are the avalanche time, the avalanche angle and the dynamic angle of repose. The user can check the effect of adjusting the value of different parameters as, for example, friction or velocity of rotation, in the final results. For this problem, it may be interesting to know the difference of potential energy for the granular material before and after the avalanche. If desired, the program can provide the user with his information by keeping track of the total energy of the mass of material at any time. This data can be found in the _Graphs_ folder.
