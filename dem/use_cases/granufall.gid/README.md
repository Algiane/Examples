# Flow test

**Author:** Salva Latorre

## Case Specification

This case simulates the emptying through a hole of a cylinder full of granular material. The target outcome for this problem is the flow rate of the escaping material. The user can study, by running this example, the effect in the final flow of adjusting key parameters as friction and rolling friction (both particle-particle and particle-walls). Obviously, it is not necessary for the user to visually compute this flow. The program can be given a specific control volume in which this calculation will be automatically done. This data can be found in the _Graphs_ folder.
