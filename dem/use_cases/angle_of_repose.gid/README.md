# Angle of repose test

**Author:** Salva Latorre

## Case Specification

This case simulates the emptying of a funnel full of granular material. The target outcome for this problem is the resulting angle of repose of the falling material. Running this example, the user can see the effect of playing with many different parameters, id est, friction, rolling friction, restitution coefficient, Young modulus, amongst others.
