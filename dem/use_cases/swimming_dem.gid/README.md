# Swimming DEM example

**Author:** Salva Latorre

## Case Specification

This case simulates the dragging of two different groups of particles under the action of a flow inside a tube. This example includes an inlet of particles. As already said, this problem includes the interaction of DEM elements with a FEM fluid. The user can study the behaviour of the DEM particles when using different types of fluids (nentonian or non-newtonian), different drag, flow velocities, etc. There is a huge number of postprocess variables available to be printed, which can provide the user with a lot of information.
